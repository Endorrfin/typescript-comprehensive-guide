/*
 * run-tests.ts — auto-discovering engine-test runner (standard §4.6). `npm test` runs this.
 * It finds every `scripts/test-*.ts`, runs each in its OWN process (so one failing test — which
 * calls process.exit(1) — doesn't abort the rest), streams their output, and exits non-zero if any
 * failed. Add a sim engine + a `scripts/test-<name>.ts` and it's picked up automatically — no
 * package.json edit. Exits 0 (green) when a fresh guide has no engine tests yet.
 *
 * Move into place as `scripts/run-tests.ts` (the bootstrap ritual does this). Run via tsx.
